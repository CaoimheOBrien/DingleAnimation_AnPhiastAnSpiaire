            <p>And so, after the kind people of Dingle Animation took pity on poor old Phiast, he decided it was just too much work being a spy.
                So he retired. The next year, he showed up to the Dingle Animation Festival, hoping, dreaming that he could repay them.
                <br><br>"You know, we could do with a mascot," they said.
            </p>
            <p>Phiast blinked, unsure if he’d heard right. A mascot? Him? He’d spent years hiding in the shadows, decoding secret messages, and now
                they wanted him to stand in front of crowds and smile? But as the laughter of the festival washed over him, he realized it wasn’t
                such a bad idea.
            </p>
            <p>The next  moment, An Phiast found himself plastered on posters and tote bags all over Dingle.For the first time in a long time, An
                Phiast wasn’t a spy or a mystery, he was family. They didn’t know the spy he had once been, nor the secrets he had carried—but they 
                didn’t need to. And so, amid laughter, cheers, and the twinkle of festival lights, An Phiast took his place as the mascot of their 
                hearts. And so, without a single soul knowing the spy he once was, Phiast twirled, bowed, and took his place as the festival’s favorite 
                oddball hero.
